#Kent Brookins HMDA Project

I pulled down HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act) data on the consumer mortgages originated in 2017 in the Louisville metro area.
The desire is to evaluate applications that were submitted and identify trends or useful information for lending institutions to evaluate historically customers.

Some of the questions I want to answer are:
  What is the distribution by county of loans?
  Which lending agencies or banks originated the loans?
  What are some useful characterstics of consumer loans by sex?
  Same as above, but broken down by race information provided?
